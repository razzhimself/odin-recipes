    <h2>Hummus is the ultimate Mediterranean dip.</h2>
    <p>
      Hummus is a dip of Arab origin made from cooked,<br />
      mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, lemon juice, and garlic.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 15 oz can of chickpeas</li>
      <li>½ cup raw tahini paste (not ready-to-eat tahini)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 large garlic clove, mashed</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>¼-½ water from chickpea can</li>
      <li>Olive oil, paprika and ground cumin for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Drain the chickpeas, reserving 1/2 cup liquid from the can. Reserve 2
        tablespoons of chickpeas for garnishing, too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend the chickpeas in a food processor or blender until you have
        obtained a rough paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add tahini, garlic, lemon juice and salt. Blend until you have a smooth
        purée. Add 1/4 cup reserved water, blending meanwhile.<br />
        Stop the machine to check the purée for desired texture. Some like their
        hummus grainier, some like it very smooth and light.<br />
        If you want a very light, creamy hummus, add reserved water, 1
        tablespoon at a time, until you're satisfied.<br />
        Don't add a lot of water at once; that may result in something more
        watery than you really want.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the hummus. Add more salt or lemon juice if desired – again, just
        a little at a time.<br />
        Resist the temptation to add more garlic at this time, because the
        garlic flavor becomes stronger over time.<br />
        Leave the hummus in its blender or food processor bowl; cover and let it
        mellow in the refrigerator for 1/2 hour.<br />
        Taste again. I find that I don't need to add garlic, but if desired, add
        a small, mashed garlic clove and blend again,<br />
        thoroughly. Serve in a medium bowl, or several smaller bowls placed
        around the table.<br />
        Sprinkle each bowl with pinches of paprika and/or ground cumin.<br />
        Draw a circle of olive oil around the surface of the hummus.<br />
        Garnish with a few reserved chickpeas.
