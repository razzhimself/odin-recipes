    <h2>A fragrant Mediterranean meal</h2>
    <p>
      Majadra is a dish consisting of cooked lentils together with groats,
      generally rice, and garnished with sautéed onions.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p><strong>For the lentils:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup brown or black lentils</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>2 onions</li>
      <li>More olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For the rice:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cup rice</li>
      <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>3 cups water, boiling</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</li>
      <li>1 ½ tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp powdered cumin</li>
      <li>¼ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>More salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p><strong>For the lentils:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pick over and rinse the lentils. Simmer them in the water,<br />
        with the bay leaf, until they are soft but not mushy.<br />
        Depending on the quality of the lentils, this might take 30-40
        minutes.<br />
        Do not add salt. Add more water if it looks like they’re drying out,<br />
        but if they finish cooking and there’s water left over,<br />
        just drain them and return them to the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salt to taste after the lentils are done. Remove the bay leaf.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>For the rice:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Rinse the rice and allow it to drain almost dry.</li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil gently and add the rice, stirring to coat the grains with
        oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the rice has become transparent, add the garlic. <br />
        Stir half a minute, then add the salt and the water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring to a boil, then cover the pot and lower the flame to the lowest
        setting.<br />
        Cook the rice until all the water has evaporated and the grains are
        tender and separate.
      </li>
      <li>While the rice is cooking, slice the onions thinly.</li>
      <li>
        Pour 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a non-stick pan and caramelize the
        onions over the lowest possible flame,<br />
        stirring once in a while. You want them very soft and golden, not brown
        and crisp.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the onions are done – in 10-15 minutes – add the cumin, cinnamon
        and a little salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Final step: Fluff the rice with a fork. Combine the cooked lentils and
        the rice, mixing gently with the fork so as not to mash them.<br />
        Stir some of the caramelized onion in, and top the dish with the rest of
        the onions.
      </li>
    </ol>
